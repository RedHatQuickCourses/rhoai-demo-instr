  - context: |
      Our clients, colleagues, regulators and shareholders all trust us and
      depend on us to act with integrity and always do the right thing, even
      when it is hard.  Our Code of Conduct is our guide to ethical behavior.
      No matter what your role is at the firm, you are responsible for
      understanding it and abiding by it. This means taking action if you feel
      something is not right. It means immediately intervening by speaking up
      if you see or suspect inappropriate behavior. It also means ensuring your
      own daily decisions stay true to our Mission and Value Proposition and are
      in our clients' interests, create economic value and are systemically responsible.
      Our success as a firm relies on our collective accountability. Just one crack in
      the foundation of trust can undermine our ability to deliver for each other and
      our clients. We each have a role at Citi, and we must hold ourselves and each
      other accountable in our daily work to achieve our goals. As you do so, know
      that we prohibit any form of retaliatory action against anyone who raises
      concerns about actual or potential wrong doing.
