= **Red Hat AI Inference Server (RHAIIS)**

Available as a standalone product and included in Red Hat OpenShift AI and Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI, AI inference server provides a powerful and flexible solution for deploying high-performance large language models across any hybrid cloud environment.

RHAIIS provides a hardened, supported distribution of the **vLLM** software via pre-packaged containers, depending on GPU type.

== Key Features of RHAIIS

At its heart, RHAIIS is built on the vLLM serving engine. The vLLM open-source project is renowned for its high-throughput and memory-efficient performance, achieved through innovative techniques like PagedAttention and continuous batching.

* **PagedAttention**: This technique optimizes GPU memory management by virtualizing the key-value (KV) cache for each request. It addresses memory wastage and lowers costs by consuming less memory.
* **Continuous Batching**: It processes requests as they arrive instead of waiting for a full batch to be accumulated, reducing latency and increasing throughput.
* **Tensor Parallelism (TP)**: This feature distributes LLM workloads across multiple GPUs, within a single node, to reduce latency and increase computational throughput. You can configure this using the `--tensor-parallel-size` argument.
// * **Pipeline Parallelism (PP)**: This stages sequential groups of model layers across different GPUs or nodes, which is crucial for fitting models that are too large for a single multi-GPU node.
* **Expert Parallelism (EP)**: RHAIIS includes specialized optimizations for efficiently handling Mixture of Experts (MoE) model architectures.
// * **Data Parallelism (DP)**: This routes individual requests to different vLLM engines.

=== Model Optimization and Compression

RHAIIS integrates the **LLM Compressor** library, a Developer Preview feature that provides a unified framework for optimizing and compressing large language models before inferencing.

* **Quantization**: This technique converts model weights and activations to lower-bit formats (such as INT8) to reduce memory usage.
* **Sparsity**: It sets a portion of model weights to zero, enabling more efficient computation.
//* **Compression**: This shrinks the saved model file size, ideally with minimal impact on performance.

[NOTE]
For RHAIIS 3.2, LLM Compressor is a Developer Preview feature and is not included in the standard container image. The product does, however, support multiple quantization variants; AMD GPUs support only FP8 (W8A8) and GGUF formats. 

=== Deployment Portability and Multi-Accelerator Support

RHAIIS is delivered as a container image downloaded from Red Hat Registry, which enables deployment flexibility and  across various connected environments.
