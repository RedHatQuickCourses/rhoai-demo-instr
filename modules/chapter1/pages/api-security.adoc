= Securing the AI Factory: A Defense-in-Depth Approach

== Why AI Security is Different

Securing a Models-as-a-Service platform requires more than just standard application security. AI and Large Language Models introduce new, unique attack surfaces that traditional security measures are not designed to handle.

As a consultant, you must be able to articulate these new risks to customers:

  * **Model Poisoning:** Malicious actors can tamper with training data or the model file itself to introduce hidden backdoors or biases.
 * **Prompt Injection:** Attackers can craft malicious inputs (prompts) to bypass safety guardrails, reveal confidential information from the model's context, or cause the model to execute unintended actions.
 * **Data Extraction Attacks:** Adversaries can interact with a model to try and reconstruct the sensitive, proprietary data it was trained on.
 * **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion):** AI inference is resource-intensive. An attacker can easily overwhelm a service with a few complex requests, leading to massive costs and service outages.

To protect against these threats, we must adopt a **Defense-in-Depth** strategy, building multiple layers of security throughout our AI Factory.

== The Layers of Defense for the AI Factory

A robust security posture is built in layers, from the code and models themselves to the infrastructure they run on and the policies that govern them.

=== Layer 1: Securing the AI Supply Chain

Security starts before the model is ever deployed. We must ensure that the assets we are building with—models, data, and code—are trusted and free from tampering.

.Checklist
* **Sign and Verify Model Artifacts:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Model Poisoning.
_Control:_ Use tools like `sigstore/cosign` to cryptographically sign model files. The platform should then verify this signature before allowing a model to be deployed, ensuring it hasn't been altered.
--
* **Use a Trusted Model Registry:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Using compromised or untrusted models.
_Control:_ Store curated, approved, and scanned models in a secure, private registry, just as you do for container images.
--
* **Generate and Maintain an AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM):**
+
--
_Threat:_ Lack of transparency and provenance.
_Control:_ Maintain a record of the model's lineage: what data it was trained on, its core architecture, and its known limitations. This is crucial for accountability and troubleshooting.
--
* **Scan All Dependencies (SBOM):**
+
--
_Threat:_ Vulnerabilities in third-party code.
_Control:_ Use tools like Syft and Grype to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and scan all dependencies in your inference server code for known CVEs.
--

=== Layer 2: Securing the Platform & Infrastructure

This layer focuses on securing the underlying OpenShift AI environment where the models will run.

.Checklist
* **Run Models in Isolated, Hardened Runtimes:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Container breakouts and privilege escalation.
_Control:_ Leverage OpenShift's built-in security by running model containers as non-root users with minimal privileges, enforced by security contexts and technologies like SELinux.
--
* **Encrypt Data At Rest and In Transit:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Data interception or theft from storage.
_Control:_ Enforce TLS for all communication. Use OpenShift's storage features with KMS integration to ensure all data, including model weights and cached datasets, is encrypted on disk.
--
* **Apply Policy-as-Code with OpenShift GitOps:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Inconsistent or insecure deployments.
_Control:_ Use GitOps to declaratively manage all MaaS configurations. This ensures that every deployment adheres to a version-controlled, peer-reviewed security standard.
--
* **Utilize Advanced Cluster Security (ACS):**
+
--
_Threat:_ Runtime vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
_Control:_ Implement Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security to scan running containers, enforce network policies, and detect anomalous behavior within the cluster.
--

'''

=== Layer 3: Securing the Service & API Endpoint

This layer protects the "front door" of your AI Factory, controlling who can access the service and what they can do.

.Checklist
* **Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Unauthorized access.
_Control:_ Secure all model endpoints through an API Gateway integrated with a corporate SSO (using OIDC/OAuth2). Every request must have a validated user token and application API key.
--
* **Validate All Input Payloads:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Prompt Injection and Denial of Service.
_Control:_ The API Gateway or the inference service itself should validate all incoming data, checking for malicious patterns, and enforcing size limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
--
* **Implement Comprehensive Auditing and Monitoring:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Undetected malicious activity.
_Control:_ Log every API request and model invocation. Integrate these logs with a SIEM (like Splunk) and monitor resource usage in Prometheus to detect anomalies, such as a sudden spike in token usage from a single user.
--

'''

== Layer 4: Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

This final layer is about the human processes and policies that govern the entire platform.

.Checklist
* **Conduct AI Risk Assessments:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Unforeseen business or ethical risks.
_Control:_ Regularly assess the AI models and platform against a standard framework like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) or ISO 42001.
--
* **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Legal and financial penalties.
_Control:_ If the platform will handle sensitive information, ensure all security controls meet the requirements of relevant regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
--
* **Maintain Incident Response Plans:**
+
--
_Threat:_ Being unprepared for a security event.
_Control:_ Develop and document a plan for how to respond to AI-specific incidents, such as a model leak, a major data extraction event, or the discovery of a critical bias.
